- make sure README are consistent for all examples and sciGTemplate
- unify tests and overlaps in all examples
- couple to gemc gui to reload geometry
- can we use geant4 default GUI and add an external GUI to it?
- add mysql/csql interface
- optical materials
- magnetic field interface?


- since json cannot do comments,
  maybe move to yaml for the configuration files? Looks much neater https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp
