** Overview

This is a test of pi- absorbtion in aluminum:

An electron is impingin in a beam dump, producing pi+ and pi- which decays:

** weak force (bf =  0.999877)

 - π+ → μ+ + νμ
 - π− → μ− + νμ*

** em force (bf = 0.000123)

 - π+ → e+ + νe
 - π− → e− + νe*


If pi- is absorbed in Al, as we expect, the electrons anti-neutrino νe* are suppresed.

The test counts the various neutrinos.


** Compilation

	With 4 cores (modify accordingly)

   - cmake .
   - make -j4


** Geometry

A G4_Galactive tube encompass a beam dump made of aluminum.
In the stepping action calls to event action fill the ntuple when the step is in the scoring tube.


** Run GEMC

gemc needs to be run with the switch -recordZeroEdep to allow recording of neutrinos:

gemc -recordZeroEdep pim_absorbtion.jcard

** ROOT Analysis:

The following macro counts the number of neutrinos:

TODO:

- run this example with several physics lists
